<h1>yf API</h1>

<h2>Intended audience</h2>

<pre>
Developers who are using YF Framework to create different Web Solutions.
This guide includes example source codes which explains basic concepts of how to 
connect and use many of framework possibilities.
</pre>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<pre>
<li>Programming language: PHP (4,3+, 5,0+)
We need some of PHP modules for some specific operations:
<li>MySQL (or other used PHP RDBMS connection module)
<li>GD2 (for image resizing and checking)
<li>CURL (for some remote tasks)
None of them are required. Requirements depends on what are you doing with framework.
</pre>

<h2>Main framework concepts</h2>

<pre>
<li>The main goal for creating the framework was speed-up development of web sites written in PHP.
<li>Better to think about the framework as a new programming language that was written for specific tasks and based on PHP.
<li>It has it's own syntax and some standards for writing code for it.
<li>Each class is located in separate file with the same name with the extension ".class.php"
(ex. class yf_debug_info is located in file yf_debug_info.class.php)
<li>All classes inside framework have prefix "yf_" to avoid naming conflicts with inheritance.
<li>Every module is a class with a custom name, but there are some limitations: it's name cannot have one of the reserved core names (for all classes inside the folder "classes/").
<li>Framework could be initialized in two main types of operation: "user" (front-end) and "admin" (back-end).
</pre>

<h2>Framework features</h2>

<pre>
<li>Internal architecture that is optimimized for speed and easy code deployment (allows you to inherit and extends 
most of framework classes). 
<li>MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. It means that framework code by itself do not show anything. You need to create a "view" file (in 99% cases it will be named "index.php"), where you need to connect to the framework and initialize "controller" (classes/main.class.php).
<li>Database abstraction layer that supports many of popular RDBMS (MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc).
<li>Template engine, that supports simple conditional and cycle patterns and custom methods.
<li>Localization engine for creating multi-language interfaces.
<li>Custom PHP errors handler.
<li>Multi-level caching system.
<li>User groups permissions system.
<li>Modules installer system.
<li>Output caching system (generating static HTML on-the-fly and then reuse generated code).
<li>Skins support (with inheritance).
<li>Multiple inheritance system designed for multi-site environment (When we have one project with many different interfaces).
<li>Easy modules syntax that allows to create modules from small to large (with submodules).
<li>Encryption system with ability to work without installed Mcrypt PHP module.
<li>Authentification system.
<li>Internal visits counter (with analyser), designed for heavy traffic.
<li>Built-in in profiler allows you to easily determine bottlenecks in your code.
<li>Built -in powerful debugging system allows you to develop projects based on the framework with ease.
<li>Support for popular PHP-based technologies like PEAR, Smarty, ADODB, so if you want/need you could use any of them together
with framework internal ones.
<li>Many CMS (Content Management System) features:
<li>Blocks system allows you to create as many display areas as you need with assigning access rules for every area.
<li>Custom replace system (output filter) will replace anything in the output content without changing the project code.
<li>Menus manager allow you to create as menu menu blocks as you need, assign different templates for each, etc.
<li>Captcha class for preventing auto-posting on different areas.
<li>Transparent comments module could be easily inserted in many places where you will need comments.
<li>Static pages editor based on popular FCKEditor (cross-browser, full-featured HTML editor).
<li>Built in methods to display page contents as "send-to-a-friend", PDF, RSS, etc
<li>Mailer system with many features (can use SMTP, PHP mail(), PEAR::Mail)
<li>Search-engine optimization built-in system
<li>Rewrite links built-in system (for operate with Apache's mod_rewrite module or similar one on other web-server)
<li>Database auto-install and restore system (system partially install itself datanase structure when needed).
<li>We have many ready-to-use backend modules:
<li>User and Admin modules Editor (installer)
<li>User and Admin groups editors
<li>Backednd users editor
<li>Blocks Editor
<li>Custom Replace Editor
<li>Locale Editor
<li>Menus Editor
<li>Templates Editor
<li>Home Page Editor
<li>Static Pages Editor
<li>Simple database manager
<li>File manager
<li>Setting Editor
<li>Execution log stats analyzer and profiler
<li>Tasks Planner (for repeated jobs)
<li>User comments editor
<li>User articles editor
<li>Many useful code pre-written and available inside the framework for every project.
<li>Easy-to-understand internal code written mostly with compliance with PEAR code formatting standard.

This list is increasing every day.

<h2>Example of creating project based on yf framework</h2>

<pre>
First of all you need to place framework files somewhere on the server 
(better is out from the web server's document root). 
For encrypted version of the framework you will need installed Zend Optimizer on your 
web-server to execute the framework code.
Then you need to create such basic project structure:
Then you need to connect to the framework with such code:
We will thinf that you are working on Windows and have apache installed into the folder "d:/www/"
So you have htdocs folder "d:/www/htdocs/"
And we think that you have extracted framework from archive (or just put it there) 
into "d:/www/htdocs/ZEND_ENCODED/yf/"
</pre>

<h3>index.php source for front-end ("user" section)</h3>

<pre class="listing">
&lt;?php
// Set engine debugging mode on/off
define(&quot;DEBUG_MODE&quot;, true);
// Path to the FrameWork
define(&quot;YF_PATH&quot;, &quot;d:/www/htdocs/ZEND_ENCODED/yf/&quot;);
// Default skin
define(&quot;DEFAULT_SKIN&quot;, &quot; example_skin&quot;);
// Include main class
require YF_PATH.&quot;classes/yf_main.class.php&quot;;
// Initialize main engine
$GLOBALS['main'] = new yf_main(&quot;user&quot;, 0, 1);
?&gt;
</pre>

<h3>db_setup.php source</h3>

<pre class="listing">
&lt;?php
define('DB_TYPE', &quot;mysql41&quot;);		// Type of current DB Server to use
define('DB_HOST', &quot;localhost&quot;);	// DB Server Host Name
define('DB_NAME', &quot;example_site&quot;);// Database Name
define('DB_USER', &quot;root&quot;);		// DB Server User
define('DB_PSWD', &quot;&quot;);			// DB Server Password
define('DB_PREFIX', &quot;example_&quot;);	// Table prefix 
?&gt;
</pre>
